# Overview

DataPower provides a number of configuration management interfaces. Each of these interfaces is fully capable so anything you can do in the Web UI you can do via our Command Line Interface, likewise with the REST API, neat!

 * Web User Interface (Web UI)
 * Command Line Interface (CLI)
 * SOAP Management Interface (SOMA)
 * REST Management Interface (RMI)

# Web User Interface

Before creating your first gateway service, let's do a quick overview of the Web GUI. Tasks are grouped via icons in the left navigation bar:

 * __Services__: create new or view existing gateway services
 * __Status__: view status information about your gateway instance, such as networking, runtime requests/responses, and caches
 * __Patterns__: easily create new gateway services using the out-of-the box patterns
 * __Network__: view and configure network components and management interfaces (ie SSH, REST, SOAP, & Web GUI)
 * __Administration__: create application domains (provides configuration isolation), user accounts and much more.
   __Note__: Most of these capabilities are available in the __default__ domain (current domain). It is recommended that you create your gateway services in a new domain.
 * __Object__: configure and view objects utilized by your gateway services
